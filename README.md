# Welcome to the BYU Biophysics Group !
Here at the BYU Biophysics research group we are seeking to understand the fundamental systematic functions of the basic units of life through simplified computer simulations of real-life molecular behavior. We use computational modeling to better comprehend the physical principles at play in each of the many biological processes prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells undergo. We will be using the programming language Julia to run the simulations and create the models. Our end goal is to contribute to the general knowledge of human function and thus make medical treatment and health a reality for more people. Below you will find all the information you need to get started!

# Getting Started with random walks 
A random walk is an extremely important concept in Biophysics and it will also be the first problem you will get to work on! 
## What is a random walk ?
* Check out this amazing [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stgYW6M5o4k) which helps explains the context around and the importance of random walks 
* Check out this amazing [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3V0BJLIo_c) for an introduction to the diffusion equation
## Problem # 1
* Build a program using Julia which can simulate a random walk for t number of walkers each taking n number of steps. Plot the trajectory of the walkers in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions! Also see if you can plot the density distribution for each dimension! Feel free to compare your solution with Jack and Cayson's

## Problem # 2

* [2D Random walk](resources/SethnaStatMech_2Dwalk.pdf) problem from Jim Sethna's statistical mechanics book. This problem is insightful.


## Problem # 3

* [Bicycle Motion (2.1)](resources/Chapter_2_Giordano.pdf) problem from Giordano's textbook, chapter 2 on realistic projectile motion. Helpful in beginning to understand the coding behind projectile motion. 

## Problem # 4

* [Cannonball Trajectory (2.2)](resources/Chapter_2_Giordano.pdf) problem 2.2 from Giordano's textbook. Helpful in learning the dynamics of projectile motion in multiple dimensions. 

## Problem # 5

* [Natural Pendulum (3.3)](resources/Giordano_chap_3.pdf) problem from Giordano's textbook. Helpful in beginning to learn about chaotic motion as well as realistic harmonic motion. Take a look at problem 3.1 and 3.2 before as well for an introduction into simple harmonic motion.
