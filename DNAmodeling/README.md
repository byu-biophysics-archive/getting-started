# DNA Modeling Project
In this project we are attempting to create a molecularly accurate simulation of the process of DNA replication and separation during the process of cell division in prokaryotic bacteria cells. We are using a software devloped at Caltech known as moltemplate to run the simulations. Understanding the foundational principles that govern the replication process is at the forefront of cutting edge Biophysics research and we are seeking to make BYU one of the foremost universities in the subject. Applications of these simulations are theoretically limitless, being able to adapt medicines and treatments to target the replication of DNA in harmful bacteria in our bodies could be a solution to bacterial infections as antibiotic resistance is on the rise. Many more applications are likely to be found as we begin to develop the world's understanding of the field.

# DNA Replication
First things first it is crucial that we have a basic understanding of what current science knows about the replication and division process. Check out the following resources for some basic information.

# BYU Supercomputing
In order to run the simulation software we make use of the BYU supercomputing lab. You can find more information about that as well as apply for a supercomputing account [here](https://rc.byu.edu/)
